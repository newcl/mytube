Goal 

To stream/watch youtube video without ads locally at home, plan is to create a web app that has a web UI which allows user to submit the youtube video url and then backend can download and stream video.

Experience 

1. User finds youtube video of interest e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SguCVRVWzTc 
2. User prefix the url with local server behind a fake domain name since we run the DNS service locally as well e.g. mytube.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SguCVRVWzTc 
3. Video will start to be streamed on the page mytube.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SguCVRVWzTc. Depending the approach to load the video e.g. download the file then play or stream the video as it gets downloaded, the page should provides debug/metric information about the download or streaming.

Implementation
1. Use react to build the frontend experience 
2. Use python e.g. FastAPI to build the backend maybe use huey as the job system if needed 
3. For data persistence consider options like Postgresql (Available in the local network)
4. For cache consider redis
